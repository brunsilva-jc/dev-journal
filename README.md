# 🛠️ Tech Blog & Developer Journal

Welcome to my personal tech journal — a growing collection of tips, guides, scripts, and notes gathered from my day-to-day experiences as a developer.

Here you'll find:
- Shell scripts and command-line tricks
- Programming snippets and patterns
- Configuration notes
- Solutions to common development problems
- Anything worth remembering and sharing

This is both a knowledge base for myself and a way to give back to the community.
